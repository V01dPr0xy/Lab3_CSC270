    -Maintain a session so the admin can move to different web pages and keep credentials
    -Add/Delete pages on the site as either main categories or sub-category,

        choose one of three different themes or styles for the entire site
    -Everything must be created from scratch using original code in PHP/MySQL only
    -Maintain a Trello board that contains a complete backlog of tasks, including who is assigned 
        to do each one and a way to tract the status of 
        each (backlog, currently working on, completed, etc.)
